# HW1
## W1L2 In-Class Activity

Put your notes from the W1L2 (Thurs, Jan 9) in-class activity here.


1 How would you describe this game world in objects?

There is the player as a bunny sprite, and a green flower sprite 


2 What attributes and actions do these objects have? 

You as the bunny are able to move in cardinal directions of. Up is W down is S left is A and 
Right is D. You can use the spacebar to make a plant sprite aper. And the are two counters one for seeds remaining and one for planted once seeds 


3 How do these objects act on or affect each other 

As you plant a seed the number of seeds remaining goes down and the number of seeds planted goes up as the number of seeds remains reaches 0 you canâ€™t plant anymore 


## Devlog
Prompt: Include the HW1 break-down exercise you wrote during the Week 1 - Lecture 2 (Jan 9) in-class activity (above). If you did not attend and perform this activity, review the lecture slides and write your own plan for how you believe HW1 should be built. If your initially proposed plan turned out significantly different than the activity answers given by Prof Reid, you may want to note what was different. Then, write about how the plan you wrote in the break-down connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.


Write your Devlog here!
On the player script to detect the inputs, I used the update to check each frame to see if the player moves using input.getkeycode W A S D and space. On the start function I setup _numSeedsLeft and the UI.
To move the player I used translate function inside of the transform of the player and I multiplied the time by the speed on each frame on the appropritate axis. Then On the PlantSeed function I check is the _numSeedsLeft > 0 meaning i have seeds to plant using Instantiate to spawn it. Using the player transfrom to access the player postion and I -1 away from _numSeedLeft to get it to reach 0 at that point the if statement stops the PlantSeed from from working. While this is happening I give a +1to the _numSeedsPlanted and I reuse the UpdateSeeds from the plant count UI the UI
Finally on the PlantCountUI I receuved the two numbers related to seedsLeft and seedsPlanted I convert those numbers to a string and assign it to the _plantedText and _remainingText
