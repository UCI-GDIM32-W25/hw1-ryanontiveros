# HW1
## W1L2 In-Class Activity
1 How would you describe this game world in objects?

There is the player as a bunny sprite, and a green flower sprite 

2 What attributes and actions do these objects have? 

You as the bunny are able to move in cardinal directions of. Up is W down is S left is A and Right is D. You can use the spacebar to make a plant sprite aper. And the are two counters one for seeds remaining and one for planted once seeds 

3 How do these objects act on or affect each other 

As you plant a seed the number of seeds remaining goes down and the number of seeds planted goes up as the number of seeds remains reaches 0 you canâ€™t plant anymore 

## Devlog
On the player script to detect the inputs, I used the update to check each frame to see if the player moves using input.getkeycode W A S D and space. On the start function I setup _numSeedsLeft and the UI.

To move the player I used translate function inside of the transform of the player and I multiplied the time by the speed on each frame on the appropritate axis. Then On the PlantSeed function I check is the _numSeedsLeft > 0 meaning i have seeds to plant using Instantiate to spawn it. Using the player transfrom to access the player postion and I -1 away from _numSeedLeft to get it to reach 0 at that point the if statement stops the PlantSeed from from working. While this is happening I give a +1to the _numSeedsPlanted and I reuse the UpdateSeeds from the plant count UI the UI

Finally on the PlantCountUI I receuved the two numbers related to seedsLeft and seedsPlanted I convert those numbers to a string and assign it to the _plantedText and _remainingText

## Prof comments
Although you described how you implemented the game, it's not really clear how your implementation/code relates to the plan you wrote in the break-down activity, so unfortunately I cannot give you full credit for this Devlog. Make sure your Devlogs in the future are clearly addressing the prompt.

After pushing your Devlog, please check your repo on the Github website to make sure the formatting turned out as you expected. Also, you can remove the prompt text. This will make it a lot easier for me to read. See the [README formatting guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
